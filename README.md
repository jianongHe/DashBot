# DashBot - 1v1 Space Robot Sprint Battle Game

[ä¸­æ–‡](README-CN.md) | [English](README.md)

## ðŸŒŒ Game Background

In a distant galaxy, an abandoned space station drifts with a group of lonely coding robots.

Due to propulsion system failure, they can't walk like normal robots and can only move by **jetting out waste code from their internal cycle system**.

## ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay

You and another player each control a robot that **cannot walk**, and the only thing you can do is:

### âœ… "Hold to charge, release to jet forward with code!"

- The robot has a rotating direction pointer that **spins clockwise continuously**
- Hold down the mouse/touch to **charge**
- The longer you charge, the farther and faster you jet, with more damage (from 20 to 60)
- Once you press, **you can't cancel**â€”you must release and dash!

This forces you to **predict direction + time your move + mind-game your opponent**. One well-timed dash can flip the whole fight!
